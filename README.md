# Project_Python

This repository is intended to store the Python project.
I did not have any Python during undergraduate, so I took some courses on Coursera.
I joined in the specialization instructed by Dr Chuck from University of Michigan.
Some small projects inside the courses are archived inside this repository.

A new file was added as simple_crawler.py which is a crawler for PDF files. The URL can be modified and this crawler fits most of situations when crawling is necessary.
