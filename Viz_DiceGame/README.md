# Viz_DiceGame

This is intended to visualize the test results from a Dice Game. There are two strategies (GAIN & THROW) and each has different values. The statistics of games are stored in a text file and it reflects which strategy performs better. Specifically, the winning probability of one strategy depends on two parameters (Gain_val and Throw_val). Therefore, it is necessary to visualize the results with scatter 3D graphs, which is not clear in scatter 3D graphs especially when describing the pattern. There is a better choice of contour that uses different colours to indicate the winning probability. It is clear and straightforward.
