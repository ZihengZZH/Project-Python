# Nash Equilibria for two-player strategic game

These programs are implemented to calculate whether there is pure/mixed Nash equilibrium inside a two-player strategic game. When given a matrix with both players' payoff, it is possible to obtain Nash equilibrium and there must be at least one mixed Nash equilibrium. The exact implementation is based on NumPy within Spyder.
